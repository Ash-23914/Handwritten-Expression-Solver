In this example, we define the RBF kernel using sympy, which allows us to generate the kernel matrix for the training and test sets using symbolic expressions. We use sympy.symbols to define the symbols x1, x2, and gamma, which correspond to the input variables and the kernel parameter, respectively. We then define the RBF kernel as sympy.exp(-gamma*((x1 - x2)**2)).

We generate the kernel matrix for the training set using a nested loop over the training samples, and evaluate the symbolic expression for each pair of samples using sympy.subs. We store the result in the K matrix.

We train a non-linear SVM with the RBF kernel using svm.SVC with kernel='precomputed', which means that we pass the kernel matrix directly to the SVM instead of the input samples. We use clf.fit(K, y_train) to train the SVM.

We generate the kernel matrix for the test set in a similar way using another nested loop, and store the result in the `K_test
